Hi, I'm Neil.

I'm an security nerd, turned systems engineer, turned big data developer,
who finally saw the light and returned to InfoSec.

I focus on the intersection of data science/engineering and information security.
I use my experience developing with "Big Data" technologies like Hadoop and Apache
Spark, and architecting business analytics platforms in the banking sector, to build
tools which paint us the complete picture of the networks that we need to defend.
