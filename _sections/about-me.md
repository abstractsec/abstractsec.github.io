Hi, I'm Neil.

I'm an security nerd, turned systems engineer, turned big data developer,
who finally saw the light and returned to InfoSec.

I focus on the intersection of data science/engineering and information security.
I use my experience developing with "Big Data" technologies like Hadoop and Apache
Spark, and architecting business-oriented analytics platforms in the banking sector
to build tools to give us the whole picture of the networks that we're trying to defend.
