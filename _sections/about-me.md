Hi, I'm Neil.

I'm an security nerd, turned systems engineer, turned big data developer,
who finally saw the light and returned to InfoSec.

I focus on the intersection of data engineering and information security. I use
my experience developing with "Big Data" technologies like Hadoop and Apache Spark,
and building business-oriented analytics platforms in the banking sector to to get
the get whole picture of the networks we're trying to defend.
